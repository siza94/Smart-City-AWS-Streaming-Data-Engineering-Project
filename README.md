# Smart City End-to-End Real-Time Data Streaming Pipeline üö¶üèôÔ∏è

## üåç Project Overview

This project implements a full real-time data engineering pipeline simulating a smart city environment. By integrating IoT devices, stream processing, and cloud services, the solution enables continuous monitoring and analysis of critical urban data ‚Äî such as traffic flow, weather conditions, GPS locations, and emergency incidents ‚Äî empowering city officials with real-time insights for smarter urban management.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Real-time data ingestion** from simulated IoT sensors
- **Kafka-based message streaming** with Docker orchestration
- **Spark Structured Streaming** for processing live data streams
- **AWS S3, Glue, Redshift, Athena, and QuickSight** for cloud storage, ETL, querying, and visualization
- **Dashboards** for vehicle telemetry, congestion, weather alerts, and emergency incidents

## üß™ Use Case Scenario

The simulated use case involves a vehicle traveling between major cities while sending data like:

- Vehicle speed & telemetry
- GPS coordinates
- Weather reports
- Emergency incidents (accidents, alerts, hazards)

This pipeline processes, stores, and visualizes the data in near real-time ‚Äî ideal for smart traffic management, public safety, and city infrastructure optimization.

---

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- AWS account (with access to S3, Glue, Athena, Redshift, QuickSight)
- Python 3.8+
- AWS CLI configured

  <br />
  <em>AWS, Spark, Kafka & Zookeeper solution architecture</em>
</p>

This project implements a robust, cloud-first architecture for processing real-time smart city data:

- Kafka & Zookeeper (Dockerized): Stream vehicle, GPS, camera, weather, and emergency data from IoT simulators.
- Apache Spark: Real-time stream processing with multiple worker nodes.

AWS Cloud Services:

- S3 for raw and transformed data storage.
- Glue & Crawlers for cataloging.
- Athena for serverless querying.
- Redshift for warehousing and deep analytics.
- QuickSight for visualization.
- IAM: Secure role-based access control.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siza94/Smart-City-AWS-Streaming-Data-Engineering-Project.git
cd python jobs/smart_city.py
```


### 2. Start Kafka and Zookeeper
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Produce, Stream Data to AWS S3 bucket
Simulate IoT sensor data by pushing to Kafka topics

Launch Spark job:

```bash
docker exec -it smart_city-spark-master-1 spark-submit --master spark://spark-master:7077 --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.0,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.1,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk:1.11.469 jobs/spark-city.py
```

### 4. AWS Configuration
Configure S3 bucket and IAM roles
Run Glue Crawler to catalog data
Use Athena/Redshift for querying
Connect QuickSight to create interactive dashboards

  <em>Project Analysis</em>
</p>

The project features an interactive QuickSight dashboard for city-wide analytics and monitoring:


Live vehicle speed and temperature monitoring

Weather & air quality trends by location

Emergency incident distribution and status

Geospatial and time-series insights

---

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The ERD defines the structured schema enabling relationships between multiple data domains:

  <em>ERD Diagram</em>
</p>

Key Highlights:

vehicle_data acts as the central table linking to:

- gps_data
- traffic_data
- emergency_data
- weather_data

All supporting tables include a foreign key: vehicle_id

Optimized for efficient querying, historical analysis, and cross-domain insights.
