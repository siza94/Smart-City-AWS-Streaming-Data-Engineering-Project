# Smart City End-to-End Real-Time Data Streaming Pipeline 🚦🏙️

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project implements a full real-time data engineering pipeline simulating a smart city environment. By integrating IoT devices, stream processing, and cloud services, the solution enables continuous monitoring and analysis of critical urban data — such as traffic flow, weather conditions, GPS locations, and emergency incidents — empowering city officials with real-time insights for smarter urban management.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Real-time data ingestion** from simulated IoT sensors
- **Kafka-based message streaming** with Docker orchestration
- **Spark Structured Streaming** for processing live data streams
- **AWS S3, Glue, Redshift, Athena, and QuickSight** for cloud storage, ETL, querying, and visualization
- **Dashboards** for vehicle telemetry, congestion, weather alerts, and emergency incidents
