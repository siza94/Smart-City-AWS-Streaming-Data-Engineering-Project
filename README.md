# Smart City End-to-End Real-Time Data Streaming Pipeline 🚦🏙️

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project implements a full real-time data engineering pipeline simulating a smart city environment. By integrating IoT devices, stream processing, and cloud services, the solution enables continuous monitoring and analysis of critical urban data — such as traffic flow, weather conditions, GPS locations, and emergency incidents — empowering city officials with real-time insights for smarter urban management.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Real-time data ingestion** from simulated IoT sensors
- **Kafka-based message streaming** with Docker orchestration
- **Spark Structured Streaming** for processing live data streams
- **AWS S3, Glue, Redshift, Athena, and QuickSight** for cloud storage, ETL, querying, and visualization
- **Dashboards** for vehicle telemetry, congestion, weather alerts, and emergency incidents

## 🧪 Use Case Scenario

The simulated use case involves a vehicle traveling between major cities while sending data like:

- Vehicle speed & telemetry
- GPS coordinates
- Weather reports
- Emergency incidents (accidents, alerts, hazards)

This pipeline processes, stores, and visualizes the data in near real-time — ideal for smart traffic management, public safety, and city infrastructure optimization.

---

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- AWS account (with access to S3, Glue, Athena, Redshift, QuickSight)
- Python 3.8+
- AWS CLI configured

  <br />
  <em>AWS, Spark, Kafka & Zookeeper solution architecture</em>
</p>

This project implements a robust, cloud-first architecture for processing real-time smart city data:

- Kafka & Zookeeper (Dockerized): Stream vehicle, GPS, camera, weather, and emergency data from IoT simulators.
- Apache Spark: Real-time stream processing with multiple worker nodes.

AWS Cloud Services:

- S3 for raw and transformed data storage.
- Glue & Crawlers for cataloging.
- Athena for serverless querying.
- Redshift for warehousing and deep analytics.
- QuickSight for visualization.
- IAM: Secure role-based access control.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siza94/Smart-City-AWS-Streaming-Data-Engineering-Project.git
cd python jobs/smart_city.py
```


### 2. Start Kafka and Zookeeper
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Produce, Stream Data to AWS S3 bucket
Simulate IoT sensor data by pushing to Kafka topics

Launch Spark job:

```bash
docker exec -it smart_city-spark-master-1 spark-submit --master spark://spark-master:7077 --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.0,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.1,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk:1.11.469 jobs/spark-city.py
```

### 4. AWS Configuration
Configure S3 bucket and IAM roles
Run Glue Crawler to catalog data
Use Athena/Redshift for querying
Connect QuickSight to create interactive dashboards

  <em>Project Analysis</em>
</p>

The project features an interactive QuickSight dashboard for city-wide analytics and monitoring:


Live vehicle speed and temperature monitoring

Weather & air quality trends by location

Emergency incident distribution and status

Geospatial and time-series insights

---

## ❄️ Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The ERD defines the structured schema enabling relationships between multiple data domains:

  <em>ERD Diagram</em>
</p>

Key Highlights:

vehicle_data acts as the central table linking to:

- gps_data
- traffic_data
- emergency_data
- weather_data

All supporting tables include a foreign key: vehicle_id

Optimized for efficient querying, historical analysis, and cross-domain insights.
